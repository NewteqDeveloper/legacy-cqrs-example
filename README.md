# About

This is an example project that is starting out with integrating into RavenDB 4 in ASP.NET Core. After that, it will have a basic implementation of CQRS. See the plan below for more details

# The domain

What will we be working with? I honestly have no idea. As I get to the implementation I will update this and we will see what the domain looks like and what we're using as an example.

# What is currently in here

Currently, this project is empty, but it will soon have RavenDB4 connected and CQRS

# Plan/RoadMap

The idea is to have the following topics covered in this example

  - RavenDB4 intergration
  - CQRS (Command and Query Responsiblitiy Segregation/Seperation)
  - DDD (Domaon Driven Development)
  - Event Sourcing
  - Publish/Subscriber architecture (using RabbitMQ)
  - Clean Architecture
